                Two weeks before graduation, I find myself wrestling for a soccer ball during my consulting club's end-of-year social when I heard a snap. 
                It wasn't loud, but it was clean, like a plastic fork snapping from digging into your sweetgreen bowl.

                Immediately after, I couldn't put any weight on it (could not stand on it at all),
                I sat down on the ground and called for my friends to haul me to the nearest match.

                "Don't mind me, the game can go on!"
                <br>
                <br>
                I sat cooking in the sun, icing my ankle with our freezies when my friend
                pointed out that it had swollen immensely. I could barely rotate my ankle and the throbbing remained.
                
                With two friends under either shoulder, I hobbled over to a Lyft to the student health services.
                My physican told me to get an X-ray (conveniently not in the same building), and that's when I heard the f word: fracture.

                The soonest appointment with a sports med doc - person who can answer all the basic questions like how long will recovery be, what does rehab look lik, etc - 
                was 5 days later. It was still ridiculous to think that 5 minutes playing soccer led to this, but an accident is an accident.
                
                It didn't help that penn med had logistical issues with sending the summary notes of my doctors appointment, mistelling me the sports doc appointment day (I showed up to be shooed away), 
                that pennrides (our school's on-request free bus service) didn't work on the weekends, and that I couldn't view my <X-ray class=""></X-ray>
                
                There were no where my questions could go. my time was filled up with youtube rabbit hole spirals, eating takeout, taking painkillers so i can still study for my cs final the next friday (I still bagged that a).
